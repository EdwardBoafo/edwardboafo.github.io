            Hello! My name is Edward Owusu Boafo. I am an international student at Algonquin College, pursuing a diploma in Interactive Media Design. 
            I have always been fascinated by technology, especially web development. As my hobby, I enjoy playing soccer, 
            playing video games, and listening to music. <em>Being a tech enthusiast</em>, I like to stay 
            updated with the latest trends in technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I am passionate about cars. I often spend time learning about cars and watching videos about it on Youtube.My friends describe me as <abbr title="Outgoing and Optimistic">O&O</abbr>. 
            I believe that some problems around us can be solved through technology and creativity. 
            The balance between technology and art helps me stay motivated and energized.I hope to become the 1<sup>st</sup> person in my home country to develop a website that helps residents
            find health resources.
